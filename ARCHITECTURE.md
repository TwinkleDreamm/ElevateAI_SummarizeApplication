## üéØ Key Design Patterns

### 1. Strategy Pattern
- Multiple text chunking strategies (semantic, sentence, paragraph)
- Different summarization approaches (extractive, abstractive, structured)
- Various search strategies (local, web fallback, multi-hop)

### 2. Factory Pattern
- Dynamic model loading based on configuration
- Client creation for different AI services
- Processor selection based on file types

### 3. Observer Pattern
- Performance monitoring and metrics collection
- Logging and event tracking
- Cache invalidation and updates

### 4. Decorator Pattern
- Performance measurement decorators
- Caching decorators for expensive operations
- Rate limiting for API calls

### 5. Template Method Pattern
- Base processor class with common processing pipeline
- Prompt templates with variable substitution
- Search result formatting

## üß† Memory System Architecture

### Short-term Memory
- **Purpose**: Manages active conversation context and temporary information
- **Storage**: In-memory with configurable TTL (default 30 minutes)
- **Capacity**: Limited size (default 50 entries) with LRU eviction
- **Content Types**:
  - Conversation turns with user input/assistant responses
  - Contextual information from current session
  - Temporary facts and observations
  - Processing metadata and confidence scores

### Long-term Memory
- **Purpose**: Persistent storage of important information and learned facts
- **Storage**: Disk-based JSON files with in-memory indexing
- **Persistence**: Automatic saving of high-importance entries (threshold 0.7+)
- **Content Types**:
  - Important conversation excerpts
  - Factual information and learned knowledge
  - User preferences and patterns
  - Document summaries and insights

### Memory Consolidation
- **Process**: Automatic transfer from short-term to long-term memory
- **Triggers**: Importance threshold, access frequency, time-based
- **Frequency**: Every 5 minutes or on-demand
- **Criteria**:
  - Importance score ‚â• 0.7
  - High confidence responses (‚â• 0.8)
  - Frequently accessed information
  - User-marked important content

### Memory Integration
- **Context Enhancement**: Automatically adds relevant memory to prompts
- **Conversation Continuity**: Maintains context across sessions
- **Fact Retrieval**: Searches both memory systems for relevant information
- **Learning**: Improves responses based on past interactions
